    "- In Procedural programming you give exact instructions one by one, to be followed in order, in a linear fashion.\n",
    "- In Functional programming you create a lot of consistent input-output functions. You then compose them one after another.\n",

OOP is very versitile and can handle very large and complex projects, but it also works well with small projects without much effort.\n",
